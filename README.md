## How To Use

#### Starting the game

It's simple you don't have to do anything but to chose your color and your friends color and then start clicking the board. There's a guide for each players' move, so place your pieces. When the board is full or one of you can't put any other piece the game's done. The player with more pieces on the board wins.
